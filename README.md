This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an array element using an index that is out of bounds.  The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  This error can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The solution focuses on robust error handling and proper index checking to prevent the issue.
